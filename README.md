# Balance API

This is an API that is aimed to provide a service to help people to control their saving and monetary accounts, control their expenses.

Right now it is just the first steps, but hopefully it will grow soon.

It is done using ASP.NET 5 (we wanted to try the multi platform approach that Microsoft claims that this new version of ASP has)

## Test

```ssh

http://localhost:5000/api/values

```

Test end point
